        Source type(s): iops
        Linux ONLY (will add compatability if enough interest)


What this app does:
----------------------------------------
This will measure the IOPS (input output operations per second of random seeks) on the specified locations.


Installation
----------------------------------------
1. Untar to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.
2. If you are NOT running as root you will need to install "vmtouch" to get accurate results by overcoming cache hits. You can get it from https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch
3. Restart splunk
4. If you have a distributed environment then install the iops app or TA-iops on the indexers as well.
5. Navigate to the "IOPS" app in the app dropdown of the search head.


Notes:
----------------------------------------
If you have a distributed environment and you are forwarding all internal logs on the search heads then you should disable the scripted input on the search head(s).


Good to know
----------------------------------------
A custom command is included called "iops" that will let you test a specific file or raw device from the search web interface or from the search command line. 

	Usage: | iops -n <number of threads> -t <seconds to run> <full path of file or device>
	Example: | iops -n 5 -t 1 /var/log/messages
