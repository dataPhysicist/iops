        Linux ONLY (will add compatibility if enough interest)


What this app does:
----------------------------------------
This will measure the IOPS (input output operations per second of random seeks) on the specified locations. A bonnie++ or iozone test will give you minimum disk performance metrics. This application is designed to measure actual performance of the indexes. Because of this, it is possible you will hit cache instead of raw disk and the IOPS will be high. If you are running as root, adding a raw device to the lookups/iops_manual_file_list.csv will reduce cache hits. Also, fresh installs of Splunk will be less accurate since there will not be much data to test against. 


Installation
----------------------------------------
1. Untar to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.
2. A list of files to monitor will be generated within 20 minutes (see savedsearches.conf). By default, only the _internal and main indexes will be monitored. To add more copy default/macros.conf to local/macros.conf and add additional indexes. 
3. You can manually set a files or raw devices to be monitored by adding them to lookups/iops_manual_file_list.csv
3. Restart splunk
4. If you have a distributed environment then install the iops app or TA-iops on the indexers as well.
5. Navigate to the "IOPS" app in the app dropdown of the search head.


Good to know
----------------------------------------
A custom command is included called "iops" that will let you test a specific file or raw device from the search web interface or from the search command line.

        Usage: | iops -n <number of threads> -t <seconds to run> <full path of file or device>
        Example: | iops -n 5 -t 1 /var/log/messages
